    Front End Development (Legacy)

  <p>
    MARCH 2018. freeCodeCamp revamped their curriculum in May of 2018, 
    and while the previous projects all culminated in 
    one main certificate each for front-end and back-end, 
    the new curriculum splits major categories apart into their own mini-programs. 
    This “legacy” certificate is for completion of the old front-end curriculum.
