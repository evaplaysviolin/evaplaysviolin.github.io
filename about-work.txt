  Continued self-study for front-end web development and 
  now searching for employment.

  As always, working on “commissions” from friends and family.

  freeCodeCamp added new material to their curriculum and 
  changed their certificate structure - currently working on 
  completing those courses. Also looking into possible options 
  for co-programming instead of continuing to work solo. 
  Upcoming project: website for a local childcare facility.

  Event planning for (own) wedding. 
  Coordination of all aspects, including creation of wedding website, 
  which was the first project undertaken shortly after deciding to 
  study web development. “What’s a server side language?”

  The website ended up being really simple but functional, 
  which is what’s really important, right? Then-fiancé had to code 
  the bit where information submitted through the RSVP form 
  was recorded in a Google Sheet (above my abilities at the time). 
  Everything else (decor, food, stationery, budget) was kept track of 
  in a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets for everyone!

  Second half of two-woman team responsible for 
  planning 10,000-participant medical congress in Guadalajara. 
  Two years of Spanish in high school came in somewhat useful. 
  Upon return, immediately commenced preparation 
  for next meeting in Barcelona.

  The congress involved corralling hundreds of 
  ophthalmologists (eye surgeons) and getting them to work together 
  to compose a program for other ophthalmologists, 
  including sessions, symposia, and special presentations, 
  while we organized the information in our event management software 
  and maintained communications with all participants.

  100% work-from-home (new and exciting). Learned to spell and 
  pronounce “ophthalmology” in a hurry.

  Event management is another beast entirely, 
  with all the moving parts and people involved. 
  Organization is key, followed closely by communication. 
  Things can change at the drop of a hat and everyone has to be prepared. 
  Working from home was a learning experience - getting responses 
  from other coworkers is simply a different process when 
  the entire team is working remotely.

  Purchasing Department, AKA “The people who stock your coffee 
  and cannot believe how quickly it is consumed.” 
  Stocking 20+ essentially independent offices (not just for coffee) 
  was an exercise in maintaining both productivity and sanity.

  Floor five needs extra boxes of printer paper every two weeks 
  as opposed to floor three which only requires refreshing every month, 
  and this particular office on floor nine must have this 
  specific type of coffee creamer instead of the usual kind. 
  Spreadsheets are king, and every order has a mile of paperwork behind it. 
  Learn fast or be faced with disgruntled employees who need more binder clips, 
  pink highlighters, or compostable forks...

  Despite not knowing anything about wine, 
  was hired to handle administrative work for 
  wine certification exams. Annual conference was an experience in 
  watching sommeliers get absolutely sloshed together 
  through consecutive wine tasting sessions.

  Add scheduled exam to the calendar, print exam materials including 
  packets for each individual testee, mail out, receive back (hopefully), 
  grade (sounds impressive but it was just a Scantron machine), 
  input results, create result letters with certificates (and a pin!) 
  for the passers, rinse and repeat. 
  Still don’t know anything about wine or spirits though.

  Rumor has it that as a toddler my first steps were because 
  the stroller had just been stolen, so that’s pretty much proof 
  of my quick learning abilities.
