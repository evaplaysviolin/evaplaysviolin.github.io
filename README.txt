# Portfolio Website

[Portfolio](http://evaplaysviolin.github.io)

Updated version of my portfolio site, hopefully making it more mobile-friendly and with overall cleaner design, as well as easier to update (theoretically). More information is included this time around!

### SPA for GitHub

When I built Portfolio 1.0, I was under the impression that GitHub Pages didn't support SPAs and used a workaround. I could be wrong about it being necessary but I kept the same workaround for Portfolio 2.0 - no need to reinvent the wheel. Code from here: https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages
